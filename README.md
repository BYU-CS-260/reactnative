React Native
React NativeLinks to an external site. is an open-sourceLinks to an external site. UILinks to an external site. software frameworkLinks to an external site. created by Meta Platforms, Inc.Links to an external site. It is used to develop applications for AndroidLinks to an external site., Android TVLinks to an external site., iOSLinks to an external site., macOSLinks to an external site., tvOSLinks to an external site., WebLinks to an external site., WindowsLinks to an external site. and UWPLinks to an external site. by enabling developers to use the ReactLinks to an external site. framework along with native platform capabilities. It is also being used to develop virtual reality applications at OculusLinks to an external site.. 

The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to ReactLinks to an external site. except that React Native does not manipulate the DOMLinks to an external site. via the Virtual DOMLinks to an external site.. It runs in a background processLinks to an external site. (which interprets the JavaScriptLinks to an external site. written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via serialized dataLinks to an external site. over an asynchronousLinks to an external site. and batchedLinks to an external site. bridge.

React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React's declarative UI paradigmLinks to an external site. and JavaScriptLinks to an external site..

While React Native styling has a similar syntax to CSS, it does not use HTMLLinks to an external site. or CSSLinks to an external site.. Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views. Without React Native, developers have to write native code in the languages of the aimed platform such as JavaLinks to an external site. or KotlinLinks to an external site. for AndroidLinks to an external site., Objective-CLinks to an external site. or SwiftLinks to an external site. for iOSLinks to an external site., and C++/WinRTLinks to an external site. or C#Links to an external site. for Windows 10Links to an external site..

Learning React Native
You are now at the point in the class where you should be able to find documentation and learn a new topic on your own. You can read the getting started guideLinks to an external site. and get a React Native example working on your own. 

Here are the links you will likely need to get started using React Native/Expo. The first link talks about how to setup your environment, and the second talks about the components you will need to use instead of the html tags you are probably used to.

(setup)[https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup]
(getting started)[https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started]
The easiest way to run the apps on expo is by installing the Expo Go app on your phone and scanning the QR code that appears in the terminal after running the local development server. There are other options that allow you to run it using emulators but that requires additional setup that may not be worth it to go through for the scope of what we want you to learn in this class.

This repository Links to an external site.will provide you with some examples from prior learning activities to get you started.
